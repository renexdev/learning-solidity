# Lab: Understanding proxies, storage, contract upgrability

The idea of this project is to have a full working version on the topic [Writing upgradable contracts in Solidity by Elena Dimitrova](https://blog.colony.io/writing-upgradeable-contracts-in-solidity-6743f0eecc88). The  explanation is more or less nice but the code is messy and in the repo there is not a well implemented sample.

>Open your terminal

>Install node

>Install node packtages:
>truffle

    `npm i -g truffle`

>testrpc 

    `npm i -g truffle ethereumjs-testrpc`

>run a develepment ethereum node (edit ./truffle-config.js) in another terminal

    `testrcp`

>Test your functions (./test/yourtests.js)

    `truffle test`
