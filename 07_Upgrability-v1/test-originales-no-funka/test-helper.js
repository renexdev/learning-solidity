    //See https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc/issues/39
    //
    //Obviously, we want our tests to pass on both, so this is a
    //bit of a problem. We have to have this special function that we use to catch
    //the error. I've named it so that it reads well in the tests below - i.e.
    //.catch(ifUsingTestRPC)
    //Note that it just swallows the error - open to debate on whether this is
    //the best thing to do, or it should log it even though it's expected, in
    //case we get an error that is unexpected...
    // console.log('Error:',err)
